## Instructions

### Backend

REST API is made by a combination of Node.js, Express.js and Typescript and it is hosted on Heroku with deployment done using Docker.

### Database

MongoDB was the choice of database and I used MongoDB Atlas for it.

### Frontend

Frontend is based on Vue.js. It is hosted on Netlify using git branch. It has CI/CD implemented to it by default, so any update in the main branch in the 'frontend' folder will initiate the deploy process.
